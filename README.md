Jeppson Idea Lab Orantes App (JILOA)
====================================

The Worcester Art Museum (Worcester, MA) is featuring an interactive exhibit showing two Orantes statues
As a part of this exhibit, IPads will be on display containing information and activities pertaining the the history
and restoration of the Orantes statues. The app the Worcester State Computer Science Department is working on is
written as a webpage intented to be used with KioskPro. The use of KioskPro allows the webpage to be run as an app
on the IPads and will lock the IPad to the program.

Some features of the app include:
*  A screensaver with project details for when sessions time out
*  A slideshow with images of the Orantes and the restoration process
*  An article viewer with details about the exhibit accompanied with scrolling images
*  A coloring app where patrons can color outlines of the Orantes
*  A puzzle app to place pieces of the Orantes back together
*  A stylish and consistent UI throughout the webpage
